npm i nodemon mongoose express bcryptjs cookie-parser cors dotenv jsonwebtoken multer exceljs

nodemon
Your server’s babysitter. It watches your files and restarts the app whenever you save, so you’re not stuck 
manually stopping and starting the server like an ancient monk ringing a bell every time.

mongoose
A translator between your JavaScript code and MongoDB. Mongo stores documents; your code speaks objects. Mongoose 
handles the conversion, validation, and structure so your data doesn’t devolve into chaos.

express
The lightweight web server that gives your app structure. Routes, middleware, requests, responses—this is the
 skeleton on which the rest of your API hangs.

bcryptjs
Password scrambler. It hashes passwords in a way that’s deliberately slow to crack, making it wildly frustrating 
for anyone trying to brute-force your users’ secrets.

cookie-parser
The librarian of incoming cookies. Express doesn’t automatically know how to read cookies from a request, so this
 little helper parses them into neat JavaScript objects.

cors
A gatekeeper. Browsers don’t like strangers, and CORS defines who’s allowed to speak to your server from another 
domain. Think of it as the server's guest list.

dotenv
Secret-keeper. It loads variables from a .env file so your API keys, passwords, and other sensitive bits don’t
 end up hardcoded in your repo like a forgotten treasure map.

jsonwebtoken (JWT)
Token minting machine. It creates and verifies signed tokens that let your server remember who a user is without 
storing session data. Stateless identity with a dash of cryptographic flair.

multer
File-wrangler. It helps you process multipart/form-data, especially file uploads—images, PDFs, Excel sheets,
 whatever the user tosses your way.

exceljs
Spreadsheet whisperer. It creates or reads Excel files in pure JavaScript. Generating reports, importing data, 
exporting templates—this library handles the workbook gymnastics.
